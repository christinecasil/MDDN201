					<p><em>Spark provides a network of 2, 500 public payphones all across the country and are mainly located in the busiest public places. Although is doesn't seem like they don't get used very often, tens of thousands of calls and minutes are actually made using the payphones every month. All of the payphones accept credit card payments and about 10% accept coin payments. By extending the life and usage of payphones, Spark made most booths a wi-fi hotspot allowing people to acess 1GB free of data each day. The wi-fi enabled boxes were highly used in popular tourist spots.</em></p>
